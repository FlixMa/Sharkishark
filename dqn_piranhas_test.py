# Select a policy. We use eps-greedy action selection, which means that a random action is selected
# with probability eps. We anneal eps from 1.0 to 0.1 over the course of 1M steps. This is done so that
# the agent initially explores the environment (high eps) and then gradually sticks to what it knows
# (low eps). We also set a dedicated eps value that is used during testing. Note that we set it to 0.05
# so that the agent still performs some random actions. This ensures that the agent cannot get stuck.
